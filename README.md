# Knight-Travails

This application finds the shortest path for a knight's movement on a standard 8x8 chessboard using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. The chessboard is represented as a graph, where each square is a node, and valid knight moves create the connections (edges) between these nodes.

Given any starting and target positions, the application efficiently calculates the optimal sequence of moves for the knight to reach the target square. The primary goal is to apply graph traversal techniques to solve the problem, without requiring a graphical interface.
